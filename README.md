# What is this

# How to compile
Right now as of August 2015, these are beta files. The game may or may not be stable.
As a result, put in a bug request and I'll look over it.

1. Be sure to download Löve from www.love2d.org/
2. Make sure 'hide extensions of known file types' is unchecked (in Windows)
3. Clone it in your desktop or download the .zip. 
4. Make sure you extract it and zip the contents so that the main.lua file is on the top.
5. Rename the extension to .love.
6. 
It should look like this when you view the .zip:

Turtle Invaders/main.lua

NOT

Turtle Invaders/Turtle Invaders/main.lua
