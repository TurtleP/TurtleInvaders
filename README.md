# Turtle Invaders
A fixed-axis shooter with netplay

# What is this
This new version is a complete overhaul. It will redefine how things are done, mainly with a fresh coat of paint for several menus, gameplay, and sprites.

Right now the remake is a WIP--and likely won't be for mobile devices. Why? Because mobile games aren't my thing, never really were.
